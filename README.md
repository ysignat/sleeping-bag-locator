# sleeping-bag-locator

This app was designed to track the location of my belongings

It was an easy task till I realized, that items could be left thousands of kilometers apart from each other

Its name refers to the hours spent to find my sleeping bag, that I lent to my friend (and of course forgot whom and when I lent it to)
